        <p> Mcr-server is an original http-server based on tcp. For now, it is only for learning linux environment programming.
        Common used programming skills such as socket/io ,tcp/ip and http protocol, multiple threads, multiple processes ...
        All of them are necessary for this project. In the future, it will serve for deploying static pages(some interesting web pages crawled from net).</p>
